# Trie
Builds a "trie" from an array of words, then the trie of words can be searched by any combination of letter prefixes.

For instance, if the trie had the words "bear", "bull", "stock", and "bell", the completion list for prefix "b" would be the leaf nodes that hold "bear", "bull", and "bell"; for prefix "be", the completion would be the leaf nodes that hold "bear" and "bell", and for prefix "bell", completion would be the leaf node that holds "bell".
